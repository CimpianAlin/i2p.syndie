Syndie can be built from source with a modern (1.6+) java development kit. You
must have ant (1.7+), and the source release includes HSQLDB (2.3.1).
You will need SWT as well--grab the latest version for your OS and
architecture from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ (or from your favorite package
manager).

I2P and SWT are required to compile Syndie. You could either
  - (recommended) set properties to tell the build process where to find
    the necessary jar files. See 'build.properties' for more information.
  - (not recommended) symlink i2p.jar and swt.jar to ./lib

To build a normal java instance, run "ant pkg". To build a self-contained
syndie.jar that includes the dependencies, run "ant dist".

To run it from within the source directory, use "ant run". To run with the
alternative 'Desktop GUI', use "ant run-desktop".

To deploy your modifications into an existing Syndie install, copy
the new ./lib/syndie.jar to the Syndie install's lib/ directory

To build various packages, see the targets and instructions in
doc/web/dev.html

Syndie can be built from source with a modern (1.4+) java development
kit, or with a new GCJ (4.0+).  You must have ant (1.6.5+), and the
source release includes HSQLDB (1.8.0.5), though newer revisions
should work.

To build a normal java instance, run "ant".

To run it without any installation, run "sh bin/syndie".

To build various packages, see the targets and instructions in
doc/web/dev.html

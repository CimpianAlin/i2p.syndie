    - lots of small performance and gui tweaks

* 2007-03-15  1.005a released
    - streamline the splash screen loading, status bar updating, and thread
      rendering.  also includes some minor refactorings to improve GUI
      responsiveness.  page rendering is also improved for large messages.
    - improved image loading performance
    - trim the PRNG buffer size from 4MB to 4KB, dramatically cutting startup
      load
    - add a 200 change undo/redo buffer into the page editor
    - handle attachment-specific Syndie URIs
    - parallelize the HTTP syndication where possible
    - add a direct "pull only" archive to new users, and schedule it up to run
      automatically (to ease the out of box experience)
    - better subsequent syndication fetch handling
    - handle web rips in character sets other than UTF-8 (translating them into
      UTF-8 transparently as long as the server sends the encoding/charset type)
    - when browsing a single forum, include the forum's advertised references up
      top, giving the forum administrator a place to put any FAQs/etc
    - support nested quotes
    - run the shutdown/exit in another thread so the GUI disappears immediately,
      even if the database takes a while to clean up
    - approximately every 10 times we shut down, compact the database
    - disable the 30 second startup timeout, as slow machines that have to do
      some database recovery could exceed that period (and the timeout was only
      there for helping pre-1.0 users migrate anyway)
    - major internal refactoring to simplify integration with other GUI styles

* 2007-02-21  1.004a released
    - heavily reworked HTTP syndication to improve reliability and performance,
      and to deal with hung connections better
    - Darn's improvements for pulling from Freenet archives more efficiently
    - rework pushing to Freenet archives to improve performance and to enable
      creating new ones
    - substantial performance improvements (optimize the thread queries and
      defer heavy operations where possible)
    - more graceful importing of transient identity keys used for accessing
      private forums
    - manage a forum's advertised references, bans, and archives more clearly
    - some HTML parsing/rendering fixes
    - more of jadeSerpent's logos and splashes

    - lots of small bugfixes and tweaks

* 2007-02-02  1.003a released
    - enable more advanced authentication and authorization policies in the
      forum management GUI, controlling both who should have certain
      capabilities and automating the delivery of keys necessary to accomplish
      that.  This includes the creation of transient shared identities for
      forum authorization
    - in forums where it is possible, enable control of both who the message 
      should be authenticated from ("Author") and who the message should be
      authorized by ("Sign as")
    - reenable "hidden authors" when posting under an explicitly authorized
      forum, allowing a forum to operate without letting those not authorized to
      read the forum know who is posting
    - transparently import keys passed as references and .syndie messages
      attached to posts and forum metadata when imported.  In addition, if the
      keys imported could serve to decrypt previously undecryptable posts,
      transparently attempt to decrypt those.
    - more aggressively avoid banned forums, and for archive operators, list
      banned forums as scopes they are not interested in receiving
    - drop the 'highlights' tab, and remember the open tabs on restart
    - some redesign work for browsing threads and forums to ease navigation and
      improve performance

      fullscreen mode
    - enable F5 to serve as a refresh key along side ^R
    - add in some simple quoting functionality when replying
    - keep track of the private messages we send
    - improved threading display
    - split large HTTP pushes into sequential batches of around 100KB to reduce
      the pain of transient failures
    - run the fproxy index fetch in a separate thread, and increase its timeout
      to 5 minutes (infinity is just too big a number...)
    - clean up the freenet fetch url handling to properly support proxied
      fetches (up to 5m per message fetch, no retries)
    - add in a slew of icons from Eclipse's set, plus a few custom icons made
      by jadeSerpent
    - a whole bunch of bugfixes and tweaks

      by forum and then by thread
    - add in freenet key generation support, and more aggressive USK
      fetches (thanks Darn)
    - rework the message read/unread status to fix a few bugs, and include
      a new "mark thread as read"
    - drag and drop of messages, forums, and tabs to the bookmark bar
      and button
    - always import the standard archives if there aren't any
    - bundle a Tor archive setting as part of the default install
    - increased the syndication retries
    - use the last author as the new author (thanks tuna)
    - support pulling from Freenet archives through an HTTP proxy
      (eg fproxy.tino.i2p/USK@blah - thanks voyde)
    - add in a preview pane into the thread subtab (thanks bar)
    - color cleanup (thanks voyde)
    - lots revamped on the message editor (thanks polecat, voyde, Anonymous)
    - include separate sub tabs for different pages in a single message
    - switch tabs with Alt+Left/Right (thanks voyde)
    - make a few options "sticky" (thanks voyde, bar)
    - properly honor the message size limits (thanks bar)

* 2007-01-04  1.001a released
    - simplified running a headless archive - see bin/runhttpserv.syndie
    - improved dependency tracking during syndication
    - substantial bugfixes for syndication message selection
    - integrated bug report tool
    - revamped message threading
    - simplified message posting
    - separate functionality to backup and restore private keys and
      shared secrets (into either an encrypted zip or a plain zip)

      (name, avatar, blog/forum post authorization)
    - lots of odds and ends cleaned up

* 2006-12-26  1.000a released
    - lets call a spade a spade
    - ship a dictionary on win32/osx (1932 websters english)

* 2006-12-26  0.920a released
    - merged in the GUI

* 2006-10-27  0.919b released
    - another EepGet fix (thanks burl!)

* 2006-10-23  0.918b released
    - fix a regression in EepGet (thanks gloin and burl!)

* 2006-10-22  0.917b released
    - add hooks for scripts to be run on syndie startup and login, as well as
      a set of default preferences and aliases to be injected when a new local
      syndie nym is created.  the scripts are in the "startup" and "login"
      files in "$rootDir/scripts/".  the preferences and aliases are name=value
      pairs in that same directory in the "defaultprefs" and "defaultaliases"
      files.
    - ship with default preferences and aliases to set the default archive for
      new users to http://syndie.i2p.net/archive/, and includes a "sync"
      alias to both pull and push any changes to it.  this does not affect
      existing syndie logins, and does not overwrite existing scripts
    - keep track of old channel read keys so that we can decrypt messages that
      used them later on, but don't use them to encrypt any new messages.
      later, we can do some pruning to remove keys long ago deprecated
    - upgrade to HSQLDB 1.8.0.7
    - include an index.html in the archive directory that, by default,
      simply explains briefly what the archive is and disclaims responsability
      for the content in it.  archive operators can customize the file as they
      see fit by editing "$rootDir/archive/index.html".  That index will of
      course be visible to anyone viewing the archive on the web, and it is
      also published inside freenet archives (as are any other html files)
    - more aggressively clean up temporary files on syndie shutdown
    - fixed a regression where fetched passphrase encrypted posts did not
      properly prompt the user for the passphrase
    - add support for HTTP 301 redirects to EepGet (so freenet USKs work as
      intended)

* 2006-10-20  0.916b released
    - let the freenetpost inserts be visible on freenet's /queue/
    - automatically rebuild the index before inserting into freenet
    - make it easier for other apps to embed the text interface (by
      creating a TextUI(String[]) and .run()ing it), and to extend the
      commands known (by registering them with syndie.db.CLI)
    - deal with missing messages in threads more gracefully
    - properly pull freenet archive entries with ?forcedownload URLs

* 2006-10-15  0.915b released
    - added support for posting archives to freenet 0.7 via the 
      freenetpost command in the syndicate menu.  pulling from freenet was
      already possible through fproxy, though it now treats archive URLs
      containing USK@, SSK@, and CHK@ specially (redirecting them to the
      correct fproxy location)

* 2006-10-14  0.914b released
    - revamped HTML design (thanks HotTuna!)
    - put together a simple monotone_howto.html as a quickstart

* 2006-10-13  0.913b released
    - bundle a sample bash script for pulling websites into syndie
      (depends on wget for fetching and links for html to text conversion)
    - translate addref URIs that refer to http URLs into SyndieURIs
      transparently
    - filled in the related.html page a bit

* 2006-10-12  0.912b released
    - migrated to monotone
    - default to compact mode for thread display
    - used cervantes' syndie_nets.png image (thanks!)

* 2006-10-08  0.910a released
    - implemented the new "threads" command, allowing intra as well as
      interchannel searching based on tags, with results ordered by most
      recently updated threads.
    - implemented the new "alias" command (and associated database table),
      allowing single and multicommand aliases using ";" as a command
      delimiter.  e.g.
      "alias sync menu syndicate; getindex; fetch; schedule --put archive; post"

* 2006-10-07  0.909a released
    - added a new "history" and associated csh-style history editing
      commands (!!, !-$num, !$num, ^a, ^a^b).
    - simplify channel authorization management with new "listnyms",
      "addnym", and "removenym" commands.

* 2006-10-06  0.908a released
    - rework the database update process so we now run
      src/syndie/db/ddl_update$n.txt whenever we are upgrading from database
      schema version $n.  This is backwards compatible
    - revamp the message/metadata import process and db schema to allow 
      importing messages that are authorized/authenticated but cannot be read,
      due to a missing key or passphrase.  in turn, revamp the read/view menu
      to display the undecrypted messages appropriately, prompting for the
      valid decryption material, providable with the new "decrypt" command.
    - encrypt private channel replies with the right key and scope

* 2006-10-05  0.907a released
    - further thread rendering fixes, and support for a new "threadprev"
      command.
    - added some status and debug messages describing the progress of http
      fetches, and added a timeout for reading http response headers (which
      should come back quickly, even if there's lots of data to transfer)
    - deal with passphrase encrypted messages in the bulkimport command by
      renaming them to "pbe_msg_$num.syndie", since they require interaction
      to import ("import --in $filename" displays the prompt for decryption,
      and "import --in $filename --pass $passphrase" decrypts it).

* 2006-10-04  0.906a released
    - added a new "prefs" command and related nymPref table, allowing you
      to set persistent preferences for each nym to be loaded on login,
      including debug and paginate state, the default http proxy, and a
      default archive (allowing you to simply "getindex" without any
      arguments).  The database update is handled automatically when
      necessary without any intervention.
    - bugfix to the message thread rendering.  it should now thread correctly
    - rework the read menu to keep track of both the channels and the messages
      being rendered so you can switch back and forth without regenerating a
      channel list again -
      (channels; messages --channel 2; view --message 0; messages --channel 3)

* 2006-10-03  0.905a released
    - support "getindex --archive file:///some/path" as well as
      "getindex --archive /some/path" and "getindex --archive http://some/url"
    - removed some debug messages unintentionally left in
    - added a new FAQ (thanks bar and void!)

* 2006-10-02  0.904a released
    - further unauthorized post/reply improvements, but the changed
      archive index-all.dat and index-new.dat have changed format, so
      upgrading is mandatory (if you want to use http syndication ;)
    - revamp the released packages:
      syndie-$rev.bin.exe (java installer w/ launch4j'ed bin/syndie.exe)
      syndie-$rev.bin.zip (no installer but w/ launch4j'ed bin/syndie.exe)
      syndie-$rev.src.tar.bz2 (source only)

* 2006-09-30  0.903a released
    - don't regenerate new channel read keys each time we update the
      metadata (since they replace old ones, so we can't decrypt messages
      that were wrapped with the old keys)
    - improvements to the unauthorized post/reply processing, flagging
      messages that weren't explicitly authorized by their keys but were
      by their context as authorized (replies in channels that allow public
      replies, posts in channels that allow public posts)
    - small fixes to the syndie.bat and import.cgi
    - fixes for goofy non-defensive-programming mistakes
    - lots of bugfixes (thanks void and Complication)

* 2006-09-29  0.902a released
    - deal with EOF on stdin (thanks bar!)
    - both "?" and "help" now refer to the help command (thanks bar!)
    - properly display blank lines in posts when appropriate
    - fixed the archive index to include the right set of messages (oops)
    - added the "builduri" helper commands for building Syndie URIs
      of URLs, channels/messages/pages, and archives

* 2006-09-28  0.901a released
    - added new "backup" and "restore" commands for simple database
      archival and disaster recovery
    - added new IzPack installer and launch4j wrapper
    - support reading new posts from standard input ("addpage --in STDIN")
    - use ".syndie" as the file extension instead of ".snd"
    - display the pagination and debug toggle state after changes
      (thanks Complication!)
    - hide the automatic db init and registration output on first run,
      as the information is saved in the database anyway
      (thanks Complication!)

* 2006-09-26  0.900a released
    - First baseline release

Key:
 - pending
 X recently completed
   (longer term tasks are included in doc/web/roadmap.html)
 ? questionable task

===

- scheduled web rips (and maybe even scheduled cli scripts?  expose webrip cli for both?)
- remove duplicate nymKeys (eg "Read key 5/89 attempt failed, continuing...")
- clean up the highlight view (less text-oriented, more graphical)
- simplify pbe resolution (special link to search:pbePending=true?)
- revamp bookmark management and editing (DnD, in place editing, etc)
- manage freenet keypairs (create/specify) on the syndication screen
? custom read/browse view for web rips
- use the systray to display the highlights and for notification
- auto-import keys and archives on Import/view
? spellcheck all pages, not just one

Database:
  - Very slow, lots of issues

Documentation:
  - Include all doc/web/* files in the jar; install all in archive/ via TextEngine.buildInstallDir(),
    or make available via the GUI, or both
  - write help pages

GUI:
  - Make a decision on which GUI to use, kill the other one
  - dictionary selection GUI
  - edit theme (fonts/colors/icons, not just font size)
  - login screen when necessary
    - passphrase changes (reencrypt keys with the new passphrase)
    - lock syndie (keep it running to sync but no UI interaction sans login/pass)

Plugin:
  - Full server support in the plugin (start I2PTunnelHTTPServer with plugin/syndie/eepPriv.dat file)
  - Remove all System.exit() calls for safe plugin operation in same JVM as router
  - Migrate plugin to in-JVM operation

Sync:
  - Allow much more frequent syncing

Translation:
  - Compare TranslationRegistry.java to I2P's Translate.java, decide whether to switch to I2P's
    translation class, and set up translation files
  - edit/create translations
  - internationalize the text UI

<body><h1>Syndie - Getting started</h1>

<p>Welcome to Syndie!  The first step to make use of Syndie is to open up the
<b>Share</b> panel and configure what <i>archives</i> you want to share messages
with.</p>

<p>If you don't have any archives defined (which you won't, at first), Syndie
will offer a few default archives, configured so that you can access them through
I2P, Tor, or directly.</p>

<center><img src="tour_share_defaults.png"></center>

<p>Make any changes to the defaults that you wish, unchecking the rows you don't
want at all, and hit <b>"Save archives as your own"</b> when complete.  Alternately,
if you want to define your own archives, just hit cancel and create them manually
by hitting the <b>Add archive</b> button.</p>

<p>Once your archives have been defined, you want to schedule the time when Syndie
will actually share messages with them - the <b>Sync (just once)</b> tells Syndie
to share messages with the selected archive immediately, but just once, while
<b>Sync (recurring)</b> tells Syndie to share messages with the selected archive
immediately and repeat the sharing process periodically (to get and send new
messages).</p>

<p>Once you have shared messages with other archives, Syndie will list a number of 
items under each archive showing what was sent and what was received.  To view the
newly received messages, select the <b>View fetched messages</b> button, which will
bring you to a tree of all fetched messages organized by the forum they are posted in.
Alternately, you can hit the <b>Read</b> button, then check the <b>unread messages</b>
checkbox and hit the <b>view all</b> button, and select <b>View combined</b> to
reach similar ends.</p>

<p>There is a lot to Syndie, so please explore!  If you have any trouble, try posting
up a message (with the <b>Write</b> button) and sharing that with one of the standard
archives and help will be on the way.  If there is a problem doing that, the
developers can be reached on irc.freenode.net #i2p or on I2P's IRC network in #i2p.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

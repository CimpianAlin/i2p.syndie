<b id="decentralizedforum">Decentralized forum</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>While many different groups often want to organize discussions into an
online forum, the centralized nature of traditional forums (websites, BBSes,
etc) can be a problem.  For instance, the site hosting the forum can be
taken offline through <b>denial of service attacks</b> or administrative action.
In addition, the single host offers a simple point to <b>monitor the group's
activity</b>, so that even if a forum is pseudonymous, those pseudonyms can be
tied to the IP that posted or read individual messages.</p>

<p>In addition, not only are the forums decentralized, they are organized
in an ad-hoc manner yet fully compatible with other organization techniques.
This means that some small group of people can run their forum using one
technique (distributing the messages by pasting them on a wiki site),
another can run their forum using another technique (posting their messages
in a distributed hashtable like <a href="http://www.opendht.org/">OpenDHT</a>,
yet if one person is aware of both techniques, they can synchronize the two
forums together.  This lets the people who were only aware of the wiki site
talk to people who were only aware of the OpenDHT service without knowing
anything about each other.  Extended further, <b>Syndie allows individual
cells to control their own exposure while communicating across the whole
organization</b>.</p>

<b id="privateforum">Private forum</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Forums can be configured so that only authorized people can read the
content, or even know what pseudonyms are posting the messages, even if an
adversary confiscates the servers distributing the posts.  In addition,
authorized users can prevent any unauthorized posts from being made entirely,
or only allow them under limited circumstances.</p>

<b id="offlineforum">Offline forum participation</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Unlike traditional forums, with Syndie you can particpate even when you
are not online, "syncing up" any accumulated changes with the forum later
on when it is convenient, perhaps days, weeks, or even months later.</p>

<b id="offlinebrowsing">Offline browsing</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Syndie is not limited to simple text messages - individual web pages or
full web sites can be packaged up into a single Syndie post, and using the
<a href="#offlineforum">offline forum</a> functionality, you can browse that
web site through Syndie without an active internet connection.</p>

<b id="securereader">Secure reader</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>All applications strive for security, but most do not consider
identity or traffic pattern related information sensitive, so they do not
bother trying to control their exposure.  Syndie however is designed with
the needs of people demanding strong anonymity and security in mind.</p>

<b id="techfeatures">Technical features</b> <a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>While its structure leads to a large number of
different configurations, most needs will be met by selecting one of
the options from each of the following three criteria:</p><ul>
 <li>Forum types:<ul>
   <li>Single author (typical blog)</li>
   <li>Multiple authors (multiauthor blog)<a href="#starstar">**</a></li>
   <li>Open (newsgroups, though restrictions may be included so that only
     authorized<a href="#starstar">**</a> users can post new threads, while anyone can comment on
     those new threads)</li>
   </ul></li>
 <li>Visibility:<ul>
   <li>Anyone can read anything</li>
   <li>Only authorized<a href="#star">*</a> people can read posts, but some metadata is exposed</li>
   <li>Only authorized<a href="#star">*</a> people can read posts, or even know who is posting</li>
   <li>Only authorized<a href="#star">*</a> people can read posts, and no one knows who is posting</li>
   </ul></li>
 <li>Comments/replies:<ul>
   <li>Anyone can comment or send private replies to the author/forum owner</li>
   <li>Only authorized<a href="#starstar">**</a> people can comment, and anyone can send private replies</li>
   <li>No one can comment, but anyone can send private replies</li>
   <li>No one can comment, and no one can send private replies</li>
   </ul></li>
</ul>

<p style="text: small"><b id="star">*</b>
   reading is authorized by giving people the symmetric key or passphrase
   to decrypt the post.  Alternately, the post may include a publicly
   visible prompt, where the correct answer serves to generate the
   correct decryption key.</p>
<p style="text: small"><b id="starstar">**</b>
   posting, updating, and/or commenting is authorized by providing those 
   users with asymmetric private keys to sign the posts with, where the
   corresponding public key is included in the forum's metadata as
   authorized to post, manage, or comment on the forum.  Alternately, the
   signing public keys of individual authorized users may be listed in
   the medtata.</p>

<p>Individual posts may contain many different elements:</p><ul>
 <li>Any number of pages, with out of band data for each page specifying
   the content type, language, etc.  Any formatting may be used, as its
   up to the client application to render the content safely - plain text
   must be supported, and clients that can should support HTML.</li>
 <li>Any number of attachments (again, with out of band data describing the
   attachment)</li>
 <li>A small avatar for the post (but if not specified, the author's 
   default avatar is used)</li>
 <li>A set of references to other posts, forums, archives, URLs, etc (which
   may include the keys necessary to post, manage, or read the referenced
   forums)</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, Syndie works at the *content layer* - individual posts are
contained in encrypted zip files, and participating in the forum means
simply sharing these files.  There are no dependencies upon how the files
are transferred (over <a href="http://www.i2p.net/">I2P</a>, 
<a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a>,
<a href="http://www.freenetproject.org/">Freenet</a>,
<a href="http://www.gnutella.org/">gnutella</a>,
<a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">bittorrent</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/RSS">RSS</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Usenet">usenet</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Email">email</a>),
but simple aggregation and distribution tools will be
bundled with the standard Syndie release.</p>

<p>Interaction with the Syndie content will occur in several ways.  First,
there is a scriptable text based interface, allowing basic command line
and interactive reading from, writing to, managing, and synchronizing
the forums.  For instance, the following is a simple script to generate
a new "message of the day" post -</p>
<pre>
    login
    menu post
    create --channel 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    addpage --in /etc/motd --content-type text/plain
    addattachment --in ~/webcam.png --content-type image/png
    listauthkeys --authorizedOnly true
    authenticate 0
    authorize 0
    set --subject "Today's MOTD"
    set --publicTags motd
    execute
    exit
</pre>
<p>Simply pipe that through the syndie executable and the deed is done:</p>
<pre>    cat motd-script | ./syndie > syndie.log</pre>

<p>Additionally, there is work going on for a graphical Syndie interface,
which includes the safe rendering of plain text and HTML pages (of
course, with support for transparent integration with Syndie's
features).</p>

<p>Applications based on the old Syndie's "sucker" code will enable the
scraping and rewriting of normal web pages and web sites so that they
can be used as single or multipage Syndie posts, including images and
other resources as attachments.</p>

<p>Down the line, firefox/mozilla plugins are planned to both detect and
import Syndie formatted files and Syndie references, as well as notify
the local Syndie GUI that a particular forum, topic, tag, author, or
search result should be brought into focus.</p>

<p>Of course, since Syndie is, at its core, a content layer with a defined
file format and cryptographic algorithms, other applications or
alternate implementations will probably be brought forward over time.</p>

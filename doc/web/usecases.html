<b id="decentralizedforum">Decentralized forum</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>While many different groups often want to organize discussions into an
online forum, the centralized nature of traditional forums (websites, BBSes,
etc) can be a problem.  For instance, the site hosting the forum can be
taken offline through <b>denial of service attacks</b> or administrative action.
In addition, the single host offers a simple point to <b>monitor the group's
activity</b>, so that even if a forum is pseudonymous, those pseudonyms can be
tied to the IP that posted or read individual messages.</p>

<p>In addition, not only are the forums decentralized, they are organized
in an ad-hoc manner yet fully compatible with other organization techniques.
This means that some small group of people can run their forum using one
technique (distributing the messages by pasting them on a wiki site),
another can run their forum using another technique (posting their messages
in a distributed hashtable like <a href="http://www.opendht.org/">OpenDHT</a>,
yet if one person is aware of both techniques, they can synchronize the two
forums together.  This lets the people who were only aware of the wiki site
talk to people who were only aware of the OpenDHT service without knowing
anything about each other.  Extended further, <b>Syndie allows individual
cells to control their own exposure while communicating across the whole
organization</b>.</p>

<b id="privateforum">Private forum</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Forums can be configured so that only authorized people can read the
content, or even know what pseudonyms are posting the messages, even if an
adversary confiscates the servers distributing the posts.  In addition,
authorized users can prevent any unauthorized posts from being made entirely,
or only allow them under limited circumstances.</p>

<b id="offlineforum">Offline forum participation</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Unlike traditional forums, with Syndie you can particpate even when you
are not online, "syncing up" any accumulated changes with the forum later
on when it is convenient, perhaps days, weeks, or even months later.</p>

<b id="offlinebrowsing">Offline browsing</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Syndie is not limited to simple text messages - individual web pages or
full web sites can be packaged up into a single Syndie post, and using the
<a href="#offlineforum">offline forum</a> functionality, you can browse that
web site through Syndie without an active internet connection.</p>

<b id="securereader">Secure reader</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>All applications strive for security, but most do not consider
identity or traffic pattern related information sensitive, so they do not
bother trying to control their exposure.  Syndie however is designed with
the needs of people demanding strong anonymity and security in mind.</p>

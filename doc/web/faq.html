<b id="why">Why does Syndie matter?</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>What do forum/blogging tools have to do with providing strong anonymity?</p>

<p>The answer: <b>*everything*</b>.</p>

<p>To briefly summarize:<ul>
 <li>Syndie's design as an anonymity-sensitive client application carefully
   avoids the intricate data sensitivity problems that nearly every
   application not built with anonymity in mind does not.</li>
 <li>By operating on the content layer, Syndie does not depend upon the
   performance or reliability of distributed networks like I2P, Tor, or
   Freenet, though it can exploit them where appropriate.</li>
 <li>By doing so, it can operate fully with small, ad-hoc mechanisms for
   content distribution - mechanisms which may not be worth the effort
   for powerful adversaries to counteract (since the 'payoff' of busting
   just a few dozen people will likely exceed the cost of mounting the
   attacks)</li>
 <li>This implies that Syndie will be useful even without a few million
   people using it - small unrelated groups of people should set up their
   own private Syndie distribution scheme without requiring any
   interaction with or even awareness by any other groups.</li>
 <li>Since Syndie does not rely upon real-time interaction, it can even
   make use of high latency anonymity systems and techniques to avoid the
   attacks that all low latency systems are vulnerable to (such as
   passive intersection attacks, passive and active timing attacks, and
   active blending attacks).</li>
</ul>

<b id="whohostsarchives">Who will host Syndie archives?</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p><i>(irc log edited for clarity)</i></p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;bar&gt; a question i've been pondering is, who is later going to have balls
    big enough to host syndie production servers/archives?</li>
<li>&lt;bar&gt; aren't those going to be as easy to track down as the eepsites are
    today?</li>
<li>&lt;jrandom&gt; public syndie archives do not have the ability to *read*
    the content posted to forums, unless the forums publish the keys to do so</li>
<li>&lt;jrandom&gt; and see the second paragraph of
    <a href="usecases.html#decentralizedforum">usecases.html</a></li>
<li>&lt;jrandom&gt; of course, those hosting archives given lawful orders to 
    drop a forum will probably do so</li>
<li>&lt;jrandom&gt; (but then people can move to another archive, without disrupting
    the forum's operation)</li>
<li>&lt;void&gt; yeah, you should mention the fact that migration to a
    different medium is going to be seamless</li>
<li>&lt;bar&gt; if my archive shuts down, i can upload my whole forum to a new one,
    right?</li>
<li>&lt;jrandom&gt; 'zactly bar</li>
<li>&lt;void&gt; they can use two methods at the same time while migrating</li>
<li>&lt;void&gt; and anyone is able to synchronize the mediums</li>
<li>&lt;jrandom&gt; right void</li>
</ul>

<b id="license">What license is Syndie released under?</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>Short answer: its probably simplest to consider Syndie to be released under a
BSD-like license.</p>

<p>Medium answer: nearly all of the code is released into the public domain, with
some files under MIT or BSD licenses.  Syndie is also linked against a library
released under the GPL with the linking exception (which means Syndie does <b>not</b>
have to be GPLed)</p>

<p>Long answer: read the LICENSE file in the package.</p>

<b id="relationship">What is the relationship between Syndie and $x?</b> (<a href="#menu">up</a>)

<p>The <a href="related.html">relationship</a> between Syndie and other
efforts have been moved to their own page.</p>

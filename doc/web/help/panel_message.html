<h1>Syndie help - Message panel</h1>

<p>The message panel is simply the means to read individual messages, view
their attachments, explore any included references, and take appropriate action.</p>

<hr />
<center><img src="panel_message_header.png"></center>

<p>The top of the message contains some critical information - on the top left is
the author's avatar, name ("foofighter"), and identity hash ("fh6uCZ").  The top
right is the targetted forum's avatar, name ("syndie bugs"), and identity hash
("eu61~m").  When an author or forum is not on the user's watched list, their
avatar is shown as a red box with an X through it - as is the "syndie bugs" forum
in this scenario.  If an author is on the user's watched list, their own avatar
is shown, but if they don't have one, a green box with a question mark is shown -
as is "foofighter" in this scenario.</p>

<p>On the second row there is a set of icons providing information about the
message - move your mouse over them to see each of their meanings.  After those
icons, the message subject is shown ("Possible to ..."), followed by two dates -
the date the author said they created this message (August 9th, 2007) and the
date the local user received the message (August 10th, 2007).  While the date the
author said they created the message will almost always be true, there are
situations where it will not be.</p>

<p>The message body is fairly self-explanatory - each page in the message is
accessible in a tab, as is a tree showing where this message is located in 
relation to other messages in this thread.  For messages that include attachments,
each attachment will have its own tab - image attachments include a preview, and
all attachments offer a means to save the data to your file system.</p>

<hr />

<p>Right clicking on any of the pages will bring up the context menu, offering a
number of actions and display options.</p>

<hr />
<center><img src="panel_message_nav.png"></center>

<p>The right hand buttons offer a means to navigate to other messages.  From top
to bottom, their meaning is: go to next unread message, go to previous unread message,
go to next message in the thread (or the beginning of the next thread), go to previous
message in the thread (or the end of the previous thread), go to next message in the
thread, go to previous message in the thread, go to the beginning of the next thread,
go to the beginning of the previous thread, and jump back to the
<a href="panel_threadtree.html">Thread tree panel</a> this message was opened from.</p>

<hr />
<center><img src="panel_message_actions.png"></center>

<p>The bottom buttons offer the most common actions - <b>reply to forum</b> brings up
a <a href="panel_editor.html">Message editor panel</a> as a reply to the current
message, targetting the message's forum (this option is only available if the user is
allowed to reply to the message).  <b>Reply to author</b> brings up a
<a href="panel_editor.html">Message editor panel</a> as a reply to the current message,
targetting the message's author.  <b>Reply to admins</b> brings up a
<a href="panel_editor.html">Message editor panel</a> as a reply to the current message,
targetting the administrators of the message's forum (only the administrators will be
able to read the reply).  Finally, <b>Mark as read</b> marks the message as read.</p>

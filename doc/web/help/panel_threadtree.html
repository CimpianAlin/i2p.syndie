<h1>Syndie help - Thread tree panel</h1>

<p>The thread tree panel offers a way to review the messages in the selected
forum(s) and take appropriate action.  Individual messages are organized into
<i>threads</i> where possible - replies are listed under the message they are
in reply to, etc.</p>

<p>The top of the panel displays what forum is being shown, including the avatar,
title, and description.  However, if more than one forum is being shown, it instead
shows a generic avatar and displays the title as
<code>"Browsing multiple forums"</code>.</p>

<hr />
<center><img src="panel_threadtree_pagination.png"></center>

<p>The number of threads can grow very large, depending upon the filter criteria
used, and when it does, the threads are split up into <code>pages</code> - groups
of 20 threads at a time.  Underneath the title bar and above the actual thread
tree, the pagination bar offers buttons to go back to the first page ("<b>&lt;&lt;</b>"),
to the previous page ("<b>&lt;</b>"), the next page ("<b>&gt;</b>"), and the last
page ("<b>&gt;&gt;</b>").  In addition, the page size can be adjusted from the default
value of 20.</p>

<p>The thread tree itself is the meat of the panel, displaying the subject, author,
target forum, and posting date of relevent messages.  When multiple forums are displayed,
the top level item refers to the forum itself, prefixed by the number of threads
underneath it (e.g. "<b>(1) Polecat</b>" or "<b>(1) Potatomus</b>").  The font used
shows the read status - normal text means the message has been read, <i>italics</i>
means the message has been read but something underneath it hasn't been, and <b>bold</b>
means the message has not yet been read (or at least not yet marked as read).</p>

<p>When individual messages or forums are right clicked, the context menu is shown, 
though most of that functionality is available through the buttons on the right and
bottom of the panel.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>View the message</b> brings up the selected message in a new 
    <a href="panel_message.html">Message panel</a></li>
<li><b>Reply to the message</b> brings up a new

<li><b>Bookmark the forum</b> adds the targetted forum to the user's <i>watched list</i>,
    allowing for easy and more secure access. <i>the security aspects come from the

    selection panel, so as to reduce any confusion between similarly named
    forums</i>.</li>

<p>The filter bar offers a number of powerful controls to limit what threads and
messages to show.  The first is a drop down specifying the message's age - anything
as recent as the selected value is allowed (e.g. "<b>This week</b>" means any message
posted or received in the last 7 days).  The second is a full text search for a word
or phrase - if "<i>foo</i>" is entered, only messages whose subject, author, keywords,
or the body of any of its pages are allowed.  Note that currently it is a strict 
substring match - entering "<i>foo bar</i>" will not match messages containing
"foo baz bar".  The third filter only matches messages who have been tagged by their
author with one of the selected tags (or if "<b>Any tags</b>" is selected, this filter
is not applied).  The fourth is a checkbox to limit messages to those that the user
hasn't already read.</p>

<p>The basic filter bar covers most scenarios, but there are a number of advanced 
filtering options, accessible by hitting the "<b>Advanced</b>" button:</p>
<center><img src="panel_threadtree_filter_advanced.png"></center>
<p>The first three options allow the set of forums whose messages are being matched
to be adjusted - <b>All forums</b> means all locally known forums,
<b>Bookmarked forums</b> means all of the forums the user is watching, and
<b>Specific forum...</b> means a specific forum or forums (this is almost always the
case).</p>

<p>The next four options filter the messages based on the privacy level used by the
authors - <b>Readable by anyone</b> means messages that the author allowed anyone to
read, <b>Readable by authorized readers</b> means messages that the author used one
of the forum's secret <i>read keys</i> to limit the message's readership, 
<b>Readable by those with a passphrase</b> means messages that the author protected
with a passphrase, and <b>Readable by forum administrators</b> means messages that
the author protected so that only the authorized administrators of the forum it was
written in could read it.</p>

<p>The next four options adjust the tree's display and behavior - if the
<b>Organize results in threads</b> option is not checked, the messages will be 
ordered chronologically without regard to any relationship between them.  If the
<b>Show a preview of the selected message</b> option is selected, when the user
hovers their mouse over a message or selects it by the keyboard, a preview window
will pop up showing the body of the message's first page.  If the
<b>Mark messages read when opened</b> option is selected, whenever a message is
shown in a <a href="panel_message.html">Message panel</a>, it is automatically
marked as read.  If the <b>Mark messages read when previewed</b> option is selected,
the popup previews will trigger the message to be marked as read as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>The right hand side of the panel has size buttons - <b>Expand</b> adjusts the
tree so that the currently selected thread is fully expanded, while <b>Collapse</b>
does the opposite.  <b>Profile</b> pulls up the profile of the selected forum.
<b>View</b> opens up the selected message in a new
<a href="panel_message.html">Message panel</a>.  <b>Read/unread</b> toggles the
read/unread status of the selected message.  <b>Create ref</b> fires up a wizard 
to save a reference to the selected message or forum in the user's references
(accessed through the <a href="panel_forumselection.html">Forum selection panel</a>).</p>

<center><img src="panel_threadtree_actions.png"></center>
<p>The bottom row of buttons offer access to some key actions -
<b>Post a new message</b> fires up a new
<a href="panel_editor.html">Message editor panel</a> targetting the selected forum
(the button is disabled if the user is not authorized to create new threads in that
forum).  The <b>Reply</b> button fires up a new 
<a href="panel_editor.html">Message editor panel</a> targetting the selected forum
as well, acting as a reply to the selected message (the button is disabled if the user
is not authorized to reply to messages in that forum).  The <b>Send a private message</b>
fires up (yet another) <a href="panel_editor.html">Message editor panel</a> targetting
the selected forum, except it has the privacy level set so that only that forum's
administrators can read it.  <b>Watch the forum</b> adds the currently selected forum
to the user's <i>watched list</i>, and <b>Ban the forum</b> deletes all messages in
the forum, all messages written by the forum's owner, and makes sure their messages are
never imported again</p>
